## Render Monitoring
- UptimeRobot pings `https://the-ingestor.onrender.com/health` every 5 minutes (keeps free-tier instance warm)
- Render free tier spins down after 15 min inactivity; UptimeRobot prevents this

---

## Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI + uvicorn, Python 3.14 (Render), deployed on Render free tier
- **Frontend:** Flutter web, deployed on Vercel
- **AI:** google-genai SDK, model `gemini-2.5-pro`
- **Storage/DB:** Supabase (Storage + Postgres)

---

## Current App State (as of 2026-05-11)

### What is fully working
- Auth (login/signup, email confirmations disabled)
- Dashboard (property grid, responsive, glassmorphism design)
- Property ingestion (SSE stream, file upload to Supabase, Gemini processing)
- Guest link generation (slug-based booking ID)
- Host panel (per-property conversation list)
- Property detail drawer (4 tabs: Overview / Files / Knowledge / Resolve)
- Edit property (per-file delete + re-ingest)
- Archived chats dialog

### Chat status (guest-facing `/chat?booking=...`)
- **Working as of 2026-05-11.** Fix: `if result and result.data:` guard in `find_or_create_conversation` (`supabase_client.py`). Committed and deployed.

---

## Architecture

### Backend (`backend/`)
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | FastAPI app, CORS from `FRONTEND_URL` env var; `/health` accepts GET + HEAD |
| `routers/ingest.py` | `POST /api/ingest` — SSE stream, sequential file processing |
| `routers/messages.py` | `POST /api/messages/web-incoming` (guest→AI), `POST /api/messages/host-send`, `POST /api/guests` |
| `services/supabase_client.py` | All DB/storage operations; singleton Supabase client |
| `services/gemini_messenger.py` | `first_pass` + `second_pass_with_search` — both async, called with 45s `asyncio.wait_for` guard |
| `services/gemini_client.py` | Low-level Gemini file upload/prompt execution |
| `services/file_processor.py` | Route by extension → correct Gemini prompt |
| `services/hash_guard.py` | SHA-256 duplicate detection |

### Frontend (`frontend/lib/`)
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.dart` | Auth guard + routes |
| `screens/auth_screen.dart` | Two-panel login/signup, password toggle |
| `screens/dashboard_screen.dart` | Property grid, aurora bg, glass app bar, staggered cards |
| `screens/add_property_screen.dart` | Property creation + ingest flow |
| `screens/chat_screen.dart` | Guest-facing chat (reads booking_id from URL) |
| `screens/chat_live_screen.dart` | Host live monitoring panel |
| `screens/host_panel_screen.dart` | Per-property conversation list |
| `screens/edit_property_screen.dart` | Edit property files + re-ingest |
| `widgets/property_card.dart` | Glass card with hover/press animation, status badge |
| `widgets/property_detail_drawer.dart` | 4-tab side drawer |
| `widgets/aurora_background.dart` | 4-blob radial gradient background widget |
| `widgets/glass_panel.dart` | Reusable glassmorphic surface (blur + hover) |
| `widgets/drop_zone.dart` | Dashed-border drag-drop zone (custom CustomPainter) |
| `widgets/generate_guest_link_dialog.dart` | 2-step dialog: name → copy URLs |
| `widgets/archived_chats_dialog.dart` | Past guests list per property |
| `services/api_client.dart` | Typed HTTP wrapper: 60s timeout, 1 retry, ApiException hierarchy |
| `theme/app_theme.dart` | Design tokens (glass, aurora, typography, shadows) |

---

## Chat Flow (how it works end-to-end)

1. Host generates a guest link via dashboard → `POST /api/guests` → returns `booking_id` slug
2. Guest opens `https://alfred-ingestor.vercel.app/chat?booking=<booking_id>`
3. `ChatScreen` reads `booking_id` from URL, loads conversation from Supabase, subscribes to messages realtime
4. Guest sends message → `ApiClient.postJson('/api/messages/web-incoming', {booking_id, message})`
5. Backend: `get_guest_by_booking_id` → `find_or_create_conversation` → `insert_message(guest)` → checks mode
   - If mode = `intervene`: returns `{status: "intervene_mode", reply: null}` (host has taken over)
   - If mode = `autopilot`: calls `gemini_messenger.first_pass` (45s timeout) → optionally `second_pass_with_search` (45s timeout) → `insert_message(ai)` → returns reply
6. Realtime subscription delivers AI message to guest UI via Supabase `.stream()`

### Error handling (frontend)
| Error | Shown to user |
|---|---|
| 504 (Gemini timeout) | "Alfred took longer than usual. Tap retry." |
| 5xx server error | "Alfred hit a temporary issue. Tap retry." |
| 404 booking | "This booking link is no longer valid." |
| Network / no response | "Can't reach Alfred. Check your connection." |

## Design System (AppTheme)
- **Primary:** `#0F766E` teal-700
- **Accent:** `#0EA5E9` sky-500
- **Background:** `#F8FAFC` slate-50 (behind aurora)
- **Glass:** `glassTint` = white@60%, `glassTintStrong` = white@80%, blur sigma 18–28
- **Aurora blobs:** teal / sky / lavender / peach at 4 corners, blur sigma 60
- **Typography:** Poppins (headings) + Inter (body)
- **Animations:** 150–300ms ease-out; `.withValues(alpha:)` throughout (Flutter 3.27+)

---

## Conversation Modes
| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `autopilot` | AI replies automatically (normal state) |
| `intervene` | Host has taken over; AI is paused |

To reset a conversation back to AI: `UPDATE conversations SET mode = 'autopilot', ai_status = 'active' WHERE booking_id = '<id>';`
Note: `'auto'` is NOT a valid value — constraint will reject it.

## Pending Actions

### ✅ Done (2026-05-11)
- `backend/services/supabase_client.py` — NoneType crash fix pushed and live
- `backend/main.py` — `/health` HEAD support live; UptimeRobot confirmed working
- Chat confirmed working end-to-end
- Escalation resolve flow + learning system (2026-05-11)
- New columns: `properties.learned_knowledge`, `conversations.escalation_reason`, `messages.used_learned_knowledge`
- New endpoint: `POST /api/conversations/resolve`
- New service function: `gemini_messenger.summarize_escalation` (gemini-2.5-flash)
- UI: resolve button in intervene mode, escalation window coloring, emergency styling, automated-learning badge, property card alert pills

### Supabase (if not done yet)
- Set Site URL → `https://alfred-ingestor.vercel.app` (Auth → URL Configuration)
- Add Redirect URL → `https://alfred-ingestor.vercel.app/**`
- Run Storage policies (3 `CREATE POLICY` statements — see session 2026-05-07 Part 3 in git history)
- `UPDATE properties SET owner_id = 'f86ebcae-683d-4914-837b-caaedca6a19d';`

### Lower priority
- **Reservations calendar** — placeholder button exists; no real data yet
- **Active chat count definition** — currently counts all guests, not filtered by recency
- **Add** `INGESTOR_SUPABASE_URL`/`INGESTOR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to Render scraper env vars
- **End-to-end REQ-08 test** (CSV upload)
- **Google Cloud Run migration** — eliminates Render cold-start entirely; need to write Dockerfile

---

## Known Constraints
- Render free tier: 15-min inactivity spin-down; mitigated by UptimeRobot 5-min ping
- `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=45)` guards both Gemini calls — if Gemini hangs, client gets a structured 504 (not a raw connection kill)
- Supabase singleton client (`_client`) is shared across `asyncio.to_thread` calls — thread-safe in practice because supabase-py uses httpx which is connection-pool safe, but worth watching
- `conversations_mode_check` constraint only allows `'autopilot'` and `'intervene'` — not `'auto'`
